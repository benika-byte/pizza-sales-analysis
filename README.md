Pizza Sales Report - Analysis 
This project is a Power BI dashboard that analyzes pizza sales data to provide useful insights into 
business performance. It helps restaurant owners and managers understand their sales trends, 
best-selling pizzas, and customer preferences. The dashboard presents data in a clear and 
interactive way, making it easier to make informed business decisions.  
The report includes key metrics such as total revenue, sales by pizza category, top-selling 
pizzas, and order trends over time. It also highlights which pizza sizes are most popular and 
which days or times have the highest sales. By analyzing this data, businesses can improve 
inventory management, optimize pricing strategies, and plan marketing campaigns more 
effectively.  
One of the main benefits of this dashboard is its ability to identify high-performing and low
performing menu items. If certain pizzas are not selling well, businesses can decide whether to 
promote them more or replace them with new options. Similarly, if some pizzas are selling 
exceptionally well, the restaurant can ensure they have enough ingredients in stock to meet 
demand.  
The dashboard may also include seasonal trends, showing how sales fluctuate across different 
months. This information can help businesses prepare for peak seasons and adjust their 
operations accordingly.  
Overall, this Power BI project provides a data-driven approach to managing a pizza business. It 
transforms raw sales data into meaningful insights that help improve efficiency and profitability. 
Whether you are a small pizza shop or a large chain, this report can be a valuable tool to 
optimize your sales strategy
